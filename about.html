I am a web developer and programming teacher, and a former English teacher. I have been writing bash scripts and using linux for the past ten years. In college I studied data structures, where I made a self-balancing binary tree in Java. That was around the same time I first installed Arch Linux.

As a web developer, I have worked with Python, Django, Javascript, Docker, and Bash scripts while working on my two primary projects. I have made an incremental game in Javascript that would save and load server-side values. I also made a regex generator in Python that comes up with a string with a corresponding regex solution, tests the generated solution against the generated string, and tests the user's regex solution against the generated string. I am currently working on a website that allows users to choose Django configurations based on radio buttons, and then launch their own Django instance in a Docker container.

As an Intro to Programming teacher, I have used Python to introduce programming concepts to students, practiced debugging code and learned what mistakes students often make. I have constructed a teaching plan to slowly introduce more difficult challenges, and provide both a conceptual and a functional understanding of solutions.
